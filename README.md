# ants-simulation
A simulation of ants using a genetic algorithm.

This project was completed as part of my coursework at Lancaster University.
The project uses a genetic algorithm to simulate ants. Ants undergo evolution through generations until we produce ants with the best fitness.
Ants are tested on their ability to survive in the environment and find food.
